# QCNN
"QCNN_1.ipynb" is a demo of QCNN realization with 2 convolution layers and 2 pooling layers on MNIST. The input is downsampled to (4,4).   <br/>
"QCNN_2.ipynb" apply some changes to the circuit of "QCNN_1.ipynb", contributing to higher accuracy and faster convergence speed.   <br/>
You can compare QCNN with "CNN.ipynb" and "DNN.ipynb", which are purely classical.
